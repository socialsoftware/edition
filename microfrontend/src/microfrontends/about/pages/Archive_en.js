	The <em>LdoD Archive</em> is a collaborative digital archive of the <em>Book
		of Disquiet</em> by Fernando Pessoa. It contains images of the autograph
	documents, new transcriptions of those documents and also
	transcriptions of four editions of the work. In addition to reading and
	comparing transcriptions, the <em>LdoD Archive</em> enables users to
	collaborate in creating virtual editions of the <em>Book of
		Disquiet.</em> It also includes a writing module which, in the future, will
	allow users to write variations based on fragments from the <em>Book</em>. Thus
	the <em>LdoD Archive</em> combines a representational principle with a
	simulation principle: the first is expressed through the representation
	of the history and processes of writing and editing the <em>Book</em>;
	the second is embodied in the fact that users are given the possibility
	of playing various roles in the literary process (reading, editing,
	writing), using the flexibility of the digital medium for experimenting
	with the <em>Book of Disquiet</em> as a literary machine.

	The main features of the <em>LdoD Archive</em> are expressed through
	six different menus:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Reading: reading the work according to different sequences;</li>
	<li>Documents: listing of all fragments and information about
		sources;</li>
	<li>Editions: visualizing autographs and comparing transcriptions;</li>
	<li>Search: selecting fragments according to multiple criteria;</li>
	<li>Virtual: creating virtual editions and their taxonomies;</li>
	<li>Writing: writing variations based on the fragments [<em>functionality
			under development</em>].
	</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The <em>LdoD Archive</em> has the following main objectives:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>To facilitate the construction of multiple reading paths that
		explore the modularity of the <em>Book of Disquiet</em>;
	</li>
	<li>To enable the construction of narratives about the composition
		of the <em>Book of Disquiet</em>, based on the observation of images
		and transcriptions of the autograph documents;
	</li>
	<li>To enable the construction of narratives about the editions of
		the <em>Book of Disquiet</em>, based on the comparative analysis of
		four critical editions (produced between 1982 and 2012) as editing
		models;
	</li>
	<li>To model literary processuality, simulating the acts of
		reading, editing and writing as dynamic constituents of the experience
		of text and language;</li>
	<li>To explore software tools and information technologies in
		order to rethink the textual practices inherited from print culture,
		including the practices of textual criticism and critical editing, and
		the practices of reading and analyzing texts;</li>
	<li>To interrogate the conceptual and material horizon of the book
		and its relation to the literary imagination;</li>
	<li>To develop a textual virtual environment that functions on
		multiple levels simultaneously, including leisure reading, study and
		analysis, advanced research and literary creation.</li>
