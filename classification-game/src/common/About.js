                                <p>The <em>LdoD Archive</em> is a collaborative digital archive of the <em>Book of Disquiet</em> by Fernando Pessoa. It contains images of the autograph documents, new transcriptions of those documents and also
                                transcriptions of four editions of the work. 
                                <br></br>In addition to reading and comparing transcriptions, the <em>LdoD Archive</em> enables users to collaborate in creating virtual editions of the <em>Book of Disquiet</em>. It also includes a writing module which, in the future, will allow users to write variations based on fragments from the <em>Book</em>. 
                                Thus the <em>LdoD Archive</em> combines a representational principle with a simulation principle: the first is expressed through the representation of the history and processes of writing and editing the <em>Book</em>; the second is embodied in the fact that users are given the possibility of playing various roles in the literary process (reading, editing, writing), using the flexibility of the digital medium for experimenting with the
                                <em>Book of Disquiet</em> as a literary machine.</p>

                                In the scope of a master's thesis developed at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico that focuses in Crowdsourcing and Gamification in the Ldod Archive, the LdoD Classification game was created. 
                                <br></br>
                                The game makes use of the LdoD Archive capabilities, which allows users to create new editions of the Book of Disquiet and share them with the other users.
