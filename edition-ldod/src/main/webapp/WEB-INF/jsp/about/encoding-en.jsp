<h3>1. The XML TEI guidelines</h3>
 <p>All transcriptions in the <em>LdoD Archive</em> have been encoded according to the <a href="http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/" target="new"><em>TEI Guidelines</em></a> (Text Encoding and Interchange). These guidelines for  text encoding have been developed since 1988 by a consortium of institutions &mdash; the <a href="http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml" target="new">Text Encoding Initiative Consortium</a>. The TEI guidelines define a large set of elements  and attributes in XML (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML" target="new">Extensible Markup Language</a>) for representing structural, conceptual, and  rendering features of texts. Considering that the XML format is both a human  and machine-readable text encoding language, TEI can be described as a textual  analysis method for digital processing. It takes advantage of the  interoperability of the XML format, in order to describe in detail textual facts  and events through a specific syntax and semantics. It is a very powerful  convention, composed of encoding modules for all kinds of problems of  representation of structures and textual forms, which extend from the invention  of writing to current electronic documents. The current version of the <em>Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and  Interchange</em> (TEI P5) was published in November 2007 and continues to be  updated periodically. At the time of writing, the latest update was made in  July 2017 (version 3.2.0).</p>

<h3>2. XML TEI applied to the <em>Book of Disquiet</em></strong></h3>
<p>
  In the case of the <em>LdoD Archive</em>,  our TEI encoding schema involved the parallel segmentation method and the definition  of a critical apparatus which treats all transcriptions as textual variations. Thus,  one can automatically compare not only variations that occur in the witnesses,  but also variations between witness transcriptions across the editions. Although witnesses are marked up as such, all variations (whether they occur in the autographs or in the editions) are processed at the same level. This encoding  decision expresses the theoretical principle that underlies the<em> LdoD Archive: </em>that of showing the <em>Book of Disquiet</em> as both authorial project  and editorial project, making it possible to observe the transformation of the  archive into editions as a dynamic process of generation of textual variations.</p>
  
<p>
  Our XML TEI encoding template embodies that which in  our virtualization model for the <em>Book of  Disquiet</em> we describe as the genetic dimension, that is, the process of  authoring (writing and rewriting), and also that which we have called the social  dimension, that is, the historical process of reinscription and socialization  of texts (editing and reediting) under specific editorial and bibliographic  forms (Portela &amp; Silva, 2014). In turn, the virtual dimension (which is the  designation of textual socialization of the <em>Book  of Disquiet</em> in the specific context of the <em>LdoD Archive</em>) consists of the possibility of constructing virtual  editions through the combination of textual units as defined by the authorial  interpretations and/or editorial interpretations (thus inheriting the XML TEI structure  of those units). The dynamism of the <em>LdoD  Archive</em> depends on the modularization produced by its data model, but also  on the versatility in comparing transcriptions enabled by its text encoding template.</p>
  
  <p>
  This way, XML TEI encoding is used simultaneously in its  representational affordance &mdash; that is, in terms of a granular description of  specific events on the inscription surface &mdash; and in its relational affordance &mdash;  that is, in terms of the instantaneous reading of micro and macrovariations at  different textual scales within the corpus. It is as if all transcriptions of  all witnesses and editions were part of a single tree, making words,  punctuation marks, blank spaces, paragraph divisions, and text divisions  comparable to each other. The exhaustiveness and complexity of the encoding of  the variations allows us to move recursively across three scales: the scale of  character, punctuation mark, and blank space as minimum units of inscription; the  scale of word, sentence, paragraph and textual block as semantic units; and the  scale of ordered sequence of texts and book as discursive and material  instantiations of a certain idea of the work.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>3. Encoding criteria</h3>
<p> The <em>LdoD Archive </em>team has adopted  a set of criteria for encoding the various acts of authorial and editorial  inscription. These criteria were sometimes determined by the need to simplify  the processing and visualization of marked-up text. This section explains the  main options taken to ensure the balance between the textual and semantic accuracy  of the markup, on the one hand, and the readability of the visualization of the  genetic layer and of the comparisons across the transcriptions, on the other.  Although there is a mimetic topographic component in the markup of the witnesses,  it is subordinated to the abstract data model whose main function is to  guarantee the comparability both across the transcriptions and across the  relative order of the documents in each edition. Our main goal is not to emulate  the documents but to model them for processing purposes.</p>

<p><strong>Encoding spaces and division markers</strong><br>
  Spaces between paragraphs, between title and text, and between blocks of  text have been marked up<em> in their  relative proportions</em>, both in relation to the witnesses and in relation to the  editions. Instead of first-line indentation for paragraphs, we opted for  one-line spacing between paragraphs, in order to improve the readability of the  transcriptions for screen reading. All other spaces correspond to spaces that  appear in the witnesses and editions. All division markers also correspond to dashes  and horizontal rulers that appear in the witnesses and editions. Spaces and division  markers are important elements in the articulation of the internal and external  divisions of each text.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Encoding deletions</strong><br>
  Deleted text (&lt;del&gt;) has been marked up with the values &ldquo;overstrike&rdquo; and &ldquo;overtyped&rdquo;. Both are displayed by a strike over the erased word.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Encoding additions</strong><br>
  Additions (&lt;add&gt;) have been marked up with the values &ldquo;below&rdquo;, &ldquo;above&rdquo;, &ldquo;inline&rdquo;, &ldquo;top&rdquo;, &ldquo;bottom&rdquo; and &ldquo;margin,&rdquo; which define the place (&lt;place&gt;) of the added  text in relation to the text segment to which it applies or the place where it  appears on the page. The &ldquo;margin&rdquo; value was usually reserved for added text in the  margins, but <em>not for text that simply continues  on the margins</em>, as often happens. In these cases, the change of place of  the text on the page is marked up only by a line break or a line break and a  space.</p>

  <p><strong>Encoding substitutions </strong><br>
  Encoding substitutions (&lt;subst&gt;) involves marking up a deleted  element (&lt;del&gt;) and an added element (&lt;add&gt;). The simple  visualization of the witness transcription can sometimes suggest that a given  element is an addition, since it is preceded by the sign &#8743;, generally used as a sign for inserted elements. In  such cases, the ambiguity can be clarified by selecting the &ldquo;show deleted&rdquo;, &ldquo;highlight  inserted&rdquo; and &ldquo;highlight substitutions&rdquo; boxes at the same time. In the second  paragraph of <a href="https://ldod.uc.pt/fragments/fragment/Fr044/inter/Fr044_WIT_MS_Fr044a_51" target="new">BNP/E3 1-50r</a>, for example, the interface shows an addition (dean- teira &#8743;d&rsquo;ella) when the witness has only the deletion of the  plural ending (dean- teira d&rsquo;ellas). In this case,  the option of marking up the substitution implied explicitly replacing &ldquo;d&rsquo;ellas&rdquo;  by &ldquo;d&rsquo;ella&rdquo; (as if there was, in fact, an addition), since that is the semantic  implication of the deletion. This marking up rule <em>has been applied to all occurrences where partial deletion of a word  transforms it into another word &mdash; for example, a plural into a singular or a  masculine into a feminine. </em>Although there is no addition, the change is  graphically and semantically marked up as if there was. The disambiguation of  these encoding options implies that the boxes &ldquo;show deleted&rdquo;, &ldquo;highlight  inserted&rdquo; and &ldquo;highlight substitutions&rdquo; are checked, as well as the collation  with the digital facsimile. This option was taken because of textual rendering,  since the marking up of isolated letters would result in the presentation of a  space before and after the letter, decreasing readability. The &ldquo;show deleted&rdquo;  and &ldquo;highlight inserted&rdquo; options were not synchronized (which would have helped  clarify that ambiguity) since their separate use allows users to observe  revision sites more clearly.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Encoding variants</strong><br>
  The marking up of variants is rendered through the simultaneous presence  of the alternatives in a different color from the rest of the text. Besides, when  you mouse over each variant, the associated probability value appears. This  value results from the division of the unit by the number of textual variants.  In the first paragraph of <a href="https://ldod.uc.pt/fragments/fragment/Fr044/inter/Fr044_WIT_MS_Fr044a_51" target="new">BNP/E3 1-50r</a>, for  example, the interface shows the variants &ldquo;rancor&rdquo; and &ldquo;torpor&rdquo; with a  probability of being excluded of 0.5 each (&ldquo;excl 0.5&rdquo;). When there are three  variants, the distribution is usually a combination of 0.3, 0.3 and 0.4.  However, there are cases in which the need to combine topographical markup with variant markup <em>implied the use of more  values than the number of actual textual variants</em>, since line breaks cannot be marked up inside the probability values and it is necessary to retag the  variant as a variant after each line break. In these cases, the value of the  probability is arbitrary and must be adjusted to reflect the real number of  variants, and not the number of line breaks, as it happens. It is a situation  that arises from the impossibility of nesting those two hierarchies in the XML TEI  syntax.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Encoding variations</strong><br>
  The adopted encoding also enables the observation of all variations across  the interpretations, that is, it allows us to compare our new transcription of  the witnesses against the transcription in Prado Coelho-1982 against the  transcription in Sobral Cunha-2008 against the transcription in Zenith-2012 against  the transcription in Pizarro-2010 for each fragment of the <em>Book of Disquiet</em>. The critical apparatus (&lt;app&gt;) of these  variations was classified according to five typologies (&lt;type&gt;): &ldquo;orthographic&rdquo;,  which identifies orthographic variations; &ldquo;punctuation&rdquo;, for punctuation  variations; &ldquo;paragraph&rdquo;, which marks up variations in paragraph division; &ldquo;style&rdquo;  for identifying typographic style variations (for example, use of italics or  capitals); and &ldquo;substantive&rdquo; to indicate differences in the transcribed word  (for example, when experts select divergent variants or read a particular passage  differently). Marked-up variations (which refer to the existing differences <em>in the set of all the interpretations of a  given fragment</em>) are visualized either through colour highlighting or through  the table of variations for each comparison.</p>
