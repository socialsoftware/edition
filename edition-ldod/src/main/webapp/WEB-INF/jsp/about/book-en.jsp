<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
      How can we use digital media to understand reading, editing, and writing as literary processes? How can we design the digital 
      medium in a way that goes beyond the printed codex? This book is an attempt to answer those fundamental questions by bringing 
      together a new theory of literary studies with a highly dynamic digital environment.</p>

<p>
	Using the digital archive of the modernist masterpiece <em>Book of Disquiet</em>, by the Portuguese writer Fernando Pessoa (1888-1935), 
      as case study and site for simulation and practical experiment, <em>Literary Simulation and the Digital Humanities</em> demonstrates how 
      computational approaches to texts can fully engage with the complexities of contemporary literary theory. Manuel Portela marshals 
      a unique combination of theoretical speculation, literary analysis, and human imagination in what amounts to a significant critical 
      intervention and a key advance in the use of digital methods to rethink the processes of reading and writing literature.</p>

<p>
      The foregrounding of the foundational practices of reading, editing, and writing will be relevant for several fields, including 
      literary studies, scholarly editing, software studies, and digital humanities.</p>
